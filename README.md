# password_generator
Unit 03 JavaScript Homework

This password generator was built with HTML, CSS & Javascript.  I also followed several youtube videos for assistance in creating the generator document plus adding buttons/options for using different types of characters.  I'm still finding some of this confusing and am not quite comfortable with when to use what specifically, but feel like I'm getting a better understanding by practicing activities at home as well as following up class with some online tutorials.
